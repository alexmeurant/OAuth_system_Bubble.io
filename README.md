# OAuth_system_Bubble.io
My first projet with Bubble: an **OAuth Signup and Login system** from scratch.

In this project, I designed 4 pages and edit their workflows:

- **Sign Up** page with a name field, an email field and a password/confirmation password fields with a dynamic strength indicator.
- **Log In** page checking the email and password fields.
- **Forgot password** page that send an email to reset it.
- **Welcome page** when logged displaying the user's name dynamically.
- **Update password** page when logged in order to change it.

This project gave me an excellent overview of Bubble to begin with. I will now carry out even more challenging projects :rocket:
